<p><strong>tl;dr: This post provides a brief overview of some of my biggest takeaways after my first year directing the Security Studies program at Kansas State University. Forging positive working relationships with other rank and file administrators is key, as is institutionalizing lots of the procedures that may have formerly been relegated to post-it notes on a computer monitor.</strong></p>

<p>I just finished my first year as the director of the Security Studies program here at K-State, and I’ve learned quite a bit in the last year. This post is an effort to record some of my thoughts on entering into this new role, and hopefully provide some sense of what to expect for others who find themselves taking on a similar job. I think having some knowledge in advance can be a big help, but it will likely be an adjustment regardless, and regardless of where you are I expect you’ll only be able to adapt to the role by doing it.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Prior Experience</h2>
<p>I’d headed some departmental committees in the past, but up to this point I really haven’t had any kind of “pure” administrative experience. I actually started as associate director two years ago. The Security Studies program at Kansas State is an interdisciplinary program between History and Political Science. In order to promote the involvement between the two departments, and to ease the transition into the program directorship, we have this extra position. It was a nice stepping stone of sorts, but its responsibilities are pretty sparse compared to the directorship.</p>
