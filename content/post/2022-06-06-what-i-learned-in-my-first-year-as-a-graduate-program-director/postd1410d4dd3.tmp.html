<p><strong>tl;dr: This post provides a brief overview of some of my biggest takeaways after my first year directing the Security Studies program at Kansas State University. Forging positive working relationships with other rank and file administrators is key, as is institutionalizing lots of the procedures that may have formerly been relegated to post-it notes on a computer monitor.</strong></p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Background</h1>
<p>I just finished my first year as the director of the Security Studies program here at K-State, and I’ve learned quite a bit in the last year. This post is an effort to record some of my thoughts on entering into this new role, and hopefully provide some sense of what to expect for others who find themselves taking on a similar job. I think having some knowledge in advance can be a big help, but it will likely be an adjustment regardless, and regardless of where you are I expect you’ll only be able to adapt to the role by doing it.</p>
<div id="prior-experience" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Prior Experience</h2>
<p>Up to this point I really haven’t had any kind of “pure” administrative experience. I’d headed some departmental committees in the past, but that really wasn’t comparable in any way. The Security Studies program at Kansas State is an interdisciplinary program between History and Political Science. In order to promote the involvement between the two departments, and to ease the transition into the program directorship, we have an associate director position for the program. I actually started in this role two years ago, and while it’s normally supposed to last for three years personnel changes prompted me to step into the directorship after a few months.</p>
<p>It was a nice stepping stone of sorts, but its responsibilities are pretty sparse compared to the directorship. That should probably change a bit as the onboarding experience can be a bit daunting. I frequently sent (and still send) emails to my predecessor when difficult cases arise. Since we have the position already, and since there’s just so much to understand stepping into a role like this, it makes sense to try to ease that transition and promote a bit more involvement by the associate director.</p>

<div id="workload" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Workload</h2>
<p>It’s a lot. On paper my time as associate director was only listed as 5% administrative. This year as director it will probably be something like 15-20%. But that’s still low balling how much time I devote to the position.</p>
<p>First, there’s a lot of paperwork. Students have to fill out a program of study (a roadmap of sorts, detailing planned coursework and committee members), another form if they want to change committee members, another form if they want to edit their program of study, an application to take their final examinations, and for PhD students a request for an defense examination ballot. Some of this is exceedingly irritating—for example, we don’t even have an exam, and yet students are still required to fill this out, and it often leads to errors and causes lots of needless headaches.</p>
<p>Ss director of the program nearly all of it comes through me at least once, but often up to three times—once as director, once as default program advisor, and once as default committee chair. Because a lot of the roles are assigned by default it’s typically up to the director to catch any errors as other faculty are not necessarily well versed in the requirements and process. I definitely wasn’t before stepping into this role, and I didn’t know what was normal and what was a red flag.</p>
<p>A high proportion of our MA students are active duty military officers coming through Ft. Leavenworth, and they’re usually on very tight schedules. This means we have to do some fairly intensive and repeated advising to ensure students don’t make mistakes on their schedules or paperwork. This is also true for civilian students, but the tigher timelines for the former group make it even more pressing.</p>

<div id="compensation" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Compensation</h2>
<p>Let’s start by acknowledging that most graduate program directorships are probably not compensated positions. But they should be.</p>
<p>I’m fortunate enough to receive a small stipend for summer salary, but to be honest this isn’t enough.</p>
